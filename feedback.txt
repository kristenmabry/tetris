Great work getting the output on the first guess; make sure you show your work and explain your reasoning though!

Looks great! Good job with the bonus and writing your own small test for it. 


# tetris,py day 4
Looks great!  Make sure to put your tests at the end of the code (game = Game(10,20) should be at the end along with drop_shapes()).  Also, drop_shapes() assumes that your Game instance is called 'game', which may not always be true.
For the assignment, it's ok to leave it as is since you're the only one making a Game and you call it game.
