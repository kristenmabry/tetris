# WTP CS Tetris

From here on out, we'll be working on Tetris and not assigning any other required work. You already have all the knowledge you need, so no more readings will be assigned. Review any relevant material from the textbook if needed.

As with the last assignments, we'd like you to help your classmates before moving on to future work. Please help at least three students before moving on to anything not explicity asked for.

This repository will be used for all future required assignments. Instead of updating this readme individually for each student, we'll add the next day's assignment to the [Tetris Info](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w1ev5lpg14dobtu/AABMVbrr_T9vMz-CrjB__GARa?dl=0) folder in the lectures Dropox folder.

To get started, click the green "Clone or download" button and copy the link given. Then, in a terminal, navigate to the location you want to put your new pset folder and type:
```
$ git clone {your-link-here}
```

Once you've done that, navigate to [Tetris Info](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w1ev5lpg14dobtu/AABMVbrr_T9vMz-CrjB__GARa?dl=0) and check out the newest assignment!

### Submitting your PSET
After youâ€™ve finished each day's Tetris assignment, type into the terminal:
```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Submitting block class"
$ git push
```
You can do this as many times as you'd like to. You should also change the commit message each time; you shouldn't be submitting the block class every day for the rest of WTP! The commit message should reflect what work you've actually done.
